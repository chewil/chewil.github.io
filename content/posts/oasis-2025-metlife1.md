## Oasis at MetLife Stadium – August 31, 2025  
**A Triumphant Return to New Jersey**

---

### 🎤 The Vibe & Highlights

Oasis's reunion on August 31 at MetLife Stadium felt less like a concert and more like a generational revival. As fans packed the stadium—many embracing near‑teen memories of the band—the Gallagher brothers delivered a two-hour performance that echoed their heyday, drawing from *Definitely Maybe*, *(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?*, *The Masterplan*, *Heathen Chemistry*, and *Be Here Now*.

Liam’s emotionally-charged dedication of **“Live Forever”** to the children affected by the Minneapolis shooting added weight to the night. Moments of tender sibling reconciliation—like an embrace amid fireworks—punctuated the set. The night ended on a euphoric high: “Wonderwall” bathed the stadium in vocals, and “Champagne Supernova” closed things out with a stunning fireworks display.
